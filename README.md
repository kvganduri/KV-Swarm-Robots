2 Path Planning Using PSO for 5 Robots with Velocity Obstacles
The experiment evaluates the particle swarm optimisation approach for dynamically avoiding obstacles while guiding five robots in a certain area. Aiming to maximise each robot's trajectory to prevent collisions and effectively reach its intended destinations, the PSO algorithm—which is well-known for optimising agents' emergent behaviour using simple but effective principles modelled after the collective behaviour of fish and birds—aims to maximise each robot's path. Starting the experiment uses predefined simulation parameters, including the number of robots, time step intervals, simulation time, environmental dimensions, and robot count. Starting placements and movement dynamics help to define obstacle features; robots are placed at random across the allocated area. Every robot chooses its course during the simulation depending on the collective knowledge of the purpose of the swarm and the local environmental limitations enforced by the moving obstacles. The obstacle locations change depending on their velocities at every time step. Using PSO terminology to describe local and global optimum locations, robots change their heads and speeds based on computed repulsive forces to avoid collisions. The PSO algorithm lets every robot make decisions that adapt dynamically to changes in obstacle locations. The responsiveness of the algorithm to dynamic change is illustrated when a robot detects an obstacle within a designated distance and adjusts its path to offer a safe buffer zone. For collision detection and data monitoring, perform real-time detailed documentation of robot positions, speeds, and any near-miss events. When robots approach a designated distance from a barrier, the integration of collision detection initiates the relevant evasive steps as shown in Figure 42. 
The motion trajectories of the robots and their interactions with obstacles allow one to assess the PSO's manoeuvrability in congested environments. Metrics such as target acquisition time, route efficiency, and the count of evasive measures evaluate the method's performance. The study ends with a comprehensive evaluation based on the collected data. These covers evaluating the efficiency of real-time path optimisation and collision avoidance using the PSO algorithm. The major areas of measurement are the algorithm's scalability with more robots or a more complex environment and resilience in unanticipated events. The results of this experiment are interesting because they show that PSO can be used for autonomous robotic navigation and that it might need to be improved to be used in environments with more changes.
 
6.5	Pattern Formation
The experimental validation of pattern formation focused on the Rendezvous Algorithm’s effectiveness in organizing robots into predefined geometrical shapes. The experiments were structured to analyse how smaller and larger groups of robots autonomously form patterns, ranging from simple line formations to more complex geometric shapes.
6.5.1 Plus Shape Pattern Formation 
This experiment illustrates the five-swarm robot pattern formation using the Rendezvous Algorithm. The process started with the robots being randomly or linearly positioned along one edge of the grid. Each robot was provided with onboard sensors, such as an IMU, to sense its orientation and relative motion. Without GPS or centralized coordination, the robots used only local sensing and communication to determine their position relative to nearby robots as shown in Figure 43.
